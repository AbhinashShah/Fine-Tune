 Implemented Fine Tuning on various open source models like Deepseek r1-1.5B, Mistral 7B and other smaller models.
 • Created own Q and A dataset using 10 different latest economics research papers and used supervised fine tuning on
 the same.
 • Due to compute restrictions only trained for few epochs but the fine tuned model has been able to answer the queries
 related to the papers.
 • For future reference, will explore reinforcement fine tuning algorithms like PPO, GRPO etc
